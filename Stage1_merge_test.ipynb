    "\n",
    "## What We're Doing\n",
    "We need precinct-level election results from Iowa's Secretary of State website for 2016, 2018, and 2020. Each county has its own Excel file, and there are 99 counties × 3 years = **297 files** to download!\n",

    "## Python Concepts You'll See\n",
    "- **Importing libraries**: Python's power comes from libraries (similar to Stata's packages)\n",
    "- **Variables**: Storing values like file paths and URLs\n",
    "- **Loops**: Repeating actions (like downloading) multiple times\n",
    "- **Functions**: Reusable blocks of code\n",
    "- **Conditional statements**: Making decisions (if/else)\n",

    "\n",
    "The code below shows our **first attempt** at downloading the files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Web Scraping Logic Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Build the URL** for each year's results page (e.g., `https://sos.iowa.gov/precinct-results-county-2018-general`)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Download the HTML** of that page using `requests.get(url)`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Parse the HTML** with BeautifulSoup to find all links (`<a href=\"...\">` tags)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Filter to find only the Excel files we want:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   is_excel = href.lower().endswith('.xls') or href.lower().endswith('.xlsx')\n",
    "   is_correct_year = f\"{year}general\" in href.lower()\n",
    "   \n",
    "   if is_excel and is_correct_year:\n",
    "       excel_links.append(href)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This keeps ONLY links that:\n",
    "   - End with `.xls` or `.xlsx` (it's an Excel file)\n",
    "   - AND contain the year + \"general\" in the URL (it's for this election)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   So if the page has other Excel files (like templates or old data), they get filtered out.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Download each matching file** and save it with a renamed filename\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Error Output\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this, you'll see:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ERROR: Could not load page (status 403)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does 403 mean?** HTTP status codes tell you what happened:\n",
    "- `200` = Success! \n",
    "- `403` = \"Forbidden\" — the server refused your request\n",
    "- `404` = \"Not Found\" — page doesn't exist\n",
    "\n",
    "A `403` error usually means the website detected that you're a script (not a human in a browser) and blocked you. This is called **bot protection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do we know to try \"pretending to be a browser\"?** When you get a 403 from a site that clearly exists and works in your browser, the most common cause is missing browser headers. The website checks \"who's asking?\" and if it doesn't look like a real browser, it says no."

    "\n",
    "Since we got a 403 \"Forbidden\" error, let's try making our script look more like a real browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Are HTTP Headers?\n",
    "\n",
    "When your browser visits a website, it sends extra information called **headers**. These tell the server:\n",
    "- What browser you're using (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)\n",
    "- What operating system you're on (Windows, Mac)\n",
    "- What languages you prefer\n",
    "- What types of files you can accept\n",

    "\n",
    "**Option 1: Copy from your own browser**\n",
    "1. Open Chrome → Press F12 (Developer Tools)\n",
    "2. Go to the \"Network\" tab\n",
    "3. Visit any website\n",
    "4. Click on a request → look at \"Request Headers\"\n",
    "5. Copy the User-Agent string\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 2: Search online**\n",
    "- Google \"chrome user agent string\" to find current ones\n",
    "- Websites like [useragentstring.com](https://useragentstring.com) list common ones\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 3: Use a library**\n",
    "- The `fake-useragent` Python library generates realistic headers\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the Code Does Differently\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "HEADERS = {\n",
    "    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)...',  # Pretend to be Chrome\n",
    "    'Accept': 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml...',  # What file types we accept\n",
    "    'Accept-Language': 'en-US,en;q=0.5',  # Language preference\n",
    "}\n",
    "session.headers.update(HEADERS)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The code also uses a **session** (`requests.Session()`) which maintains cookies across requests — just like a real browser remembers your login.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Result\n",
    "\n",
    "**Still fails!** This website has particularly strong bot protection that checks more than just headers. We need a different approach — controlling a real browser."

    "## Step 4: The Solution — Using Selenium (Browser Automation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the website blocks Python scripts, we need a different approach: **control a real web browser!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selenium** is a tool that lets Python control Chrome (or Firefox). It literally opens a browser window and clicks through pages like a human would. The website can't tell the difference because it IS a real browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works When Headers Don't\n",
    "\n",
    "Websites use various tricks to detect bots:\n",
    "- Checking headers (we tried faking these)\n",
    "- Running JavaScript to detect automation\n",
    "- Checking mouse movements and timing\n",
    "- Looking at browser fingerprints\n",
    "\n",
    "Selenium bypasses most of these because it's running a real Chrome browser — all the JavaScript runs normally, the fingerprint looks real, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### New Packages Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "- **selenium**: Controls the browser\n",
    "- **webdriver-manager**: Automatically downloads the correct Chrome driver\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Oops! We Forgot to Install\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the next code cell — it tries to use Selenium but fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'selenium'`. This happens when you try to `import` a package that isn't installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The fix**: Run the `pip install` cell that comes after the error."

    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Web scraping** is the process of extracting data from websites programmatically\n",
    "2. Many websites have **bot protection** that blocks simple scraping scripts\n",
    "3. **Selenium** can control a real browser to bypass these protections\n",
    "4. Python's **loops** let us repeat tasks (downloading 297 files) automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Big Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "What would have taken **hours** of clicking and downloading by hand took just a few minutes of computer time. This is the power of automation!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Skills Used\n",
    "- Installing packages with `pip`\n",
    "- Importing libraries\n",
    "- Working with file paths (`Path` from `pathlib`)\n",
    "- Loops (`for year in years:`)\n",
    "- Functions (reusable blocks of code)\n",
    "- Error handling (`try/except`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "Now that we have all the Excel files downloaded, Stage 2 will:\n",
    "- Read each Excel file\n",
    "- Extract the data we need\n",
    "- Combine everything into one dataset\n",
