# Your challenge is to set up a dashboard that provides information about precinct level elections for different elected offices in several states between 2014-2020. 

# You will get information about state election results for general elections in 2014-2020 in several states and information about the  location of large wind and solar projects during this same period.
# Your job is to build a dataset that can summarize at the state, district and precinct level
# a) votes and vote shares for candidates in each election
# b) the incumbent party in the district (and precinct)
# c) the change in votes and vote share for the incumbent party in the previous election 
# d) whether the candidate for election is the incumbent office holder
# e) whether a renewable project was built in the precincts between elections (and how many and their cumulative size)
# f) whether the district had prior renewable energy facilities (and how many and their cumulative size)
# g) (possibly) several demographic features in the district (like average income, % of minority voters, etc

# This project requires you to do several important data collection and managment tasks, drawing data from several sources (to be named), use spatial (shapefile) data, and provide a presentation laying out your results. 

# Step 1 (due 1/29) Write the code to dowload all the IOWA election results files at precinct level for 2014-2020 general elections (even years), run it to get all the files in your team folder.
# Step 2+ wil be discussed in class
