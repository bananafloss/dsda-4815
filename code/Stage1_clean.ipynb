    "\n",
    "**`wait_for_download`**: When you download manually, you wait for it to finish before clicking the next link. Computers don't wait automatically, so this function checks every half-second: *\"Is the download done yet?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**`clear_folder`**: Before each download, we empty the temp folder. Why? So when a new file appears, we know it's the one we just downloaded (not an old one). In plain English this is just \"delete all files in folder\" — but Python has no simple command for this, so we loop through and delete each file individually:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for f in folder.iterdir():   # Loop through each file\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        f.unlink()           # Delete it (.unlink = delete)\n",

    "        pass                 # If it fails, skip it\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The bigger point:** If you're thinking \"this seems like a lot of code for something simple\" — you're right! The core logic (loop through years, find links, download files) is straightforward. The extra code handles all the timing, file management, and edge cases that reality throws at you.
